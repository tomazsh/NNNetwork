/**
 `NNOAuth1Client` provides a way to communicate with an OAuth 1.0 service. It provides methods for both, a redirection-based and XAuth authorization. It also subclasses `NNOAuthClient` to implement a signing mechanism. For this, it uses the `signForOAuthWithClientIdentifier:clientSecret:method:parameters:credential:` method of `NSMutableURLRequest(NNNetwork)` category.

 ### Authorization Process
 
 `NNOAuth1Client` provides methods for a typical three step redirection-based authorization process with OAuth 1.0. You should generally implement the following approach:
 
 1. Obtain a temporary credential from temporary credential endpoint. Use `temporaryCredentialWithPath:success:failure:`.
 2. Navigate to resource owner authorization endpoint in Safari or a dedicated `UIWebView`. When the user allows your app access to his account, you should capture the user's `oauth_token` and `oauth_verifier`.
 3. Use `credentialWithPath:credential:verifier:success:failure:` to obtain credential from token request endpoint.
 
 If your OAuth service provides an XAuth authorization option, you only need to provide a user with a login form and then obtain a `NNOAuthCredential` object with `credentialWithPath:username:password:success:failure:`.
 
 ### Subclassing Notes

 You should subclass `NNOAuth1Client` as you would `AFHTTPClient`. If your OAuth service requires a specialized authorization or authentication technique, you should also consider overriding other methods.
 
 #### Methods to Override
 
 If you wish to change the authorization mechanism, you should override any of the methods `temporaryCredentialWithPath:success:failure:`, `credentialWithPath:credential:verifier:success:failure:` or `credentialWithPath:credential:verifier:success:failure:`, depending on what part you wish to change.
 
 If you wish to change the authentication mechanism, you should override mehods as described for `NNOAuthClient`.
